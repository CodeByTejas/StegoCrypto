# StegoCrypto
StegoCrypt is a Django-based hybrid encryption system that encrypts messages using AES and Triple DES algorithms, then hides them within images using steganography. This ensures both the confidentiality and invisibility of the encrypted message, offering secure communication by making the message's presence undetectable within the image.
